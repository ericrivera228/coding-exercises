# coding-exercises
Project for doing all my coding exercises so they are easily runnable and testable.

## Running the code

The root of this project is `index.ts`. To run, execute:
```
npm  start
```

## Testing the code
The project is set-up with jest. To run all tests:
```
npm test
```

Visual Studio Code is configured to debug the unit tests. To start debugging, set your breakpoints then go to `Run -> Start Deubgging`.
